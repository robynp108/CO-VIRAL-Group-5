# CO-VIRAL-Group-5
Project 1, Group 5

## Project Description
Our app aims to create a user-friendly resource for community members to easily access the most noteworthy, accurate, and verifiable content regarding COVID-19, and other emerging health concerns, through a simple, direct, and responsive platform. 

By “bypassing” social media and using only the above described sources of information, our app aims to educate, inform, and calm users during the health crisis caused by COVID-19. In the future, our app can be used to remain informed regarding other noteworthy or emerging health concerns.
